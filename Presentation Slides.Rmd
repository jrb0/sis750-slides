# Overview

.pull-left[## Question:

- Does the success of a given MLB team in a particular year cause **rent prices in nearby homes and apartments to rise** in the following year?]

.pull-right[## Findings:

- For every additional win earned by an MLB team in a particular year, rent prices in the zip code where the stadium is located are expected to rise **$2.25/month** the following year _(after controlling for citywide rent prices)_.]

# Data

## Rent Data

- **Zillow Observed Rent Index** _(ZORI)_
  - Mean of listed rents that fall into the 35th to 65th percentile range for all homes and apartments in a given region.

## Historical Wins by Year by MLB Team

- Pulled from **Lahman Baseball Database** using r package "Lahman".
- Tested wins variable **lagged by 1, 2, and 3 years** to understand postponed effects of success.

# After controlling for citywide rent prices, each additional win was associated with a **$2.25/month** rise in average rent price.

# Some key takeaways 

.pull-left[
- Rent price as a potential confounding variable; **citywide rent variable added as control** to account for noise introduced by variations in rent price.

- **Strongest effect** was seen in the year immediately following a successful season.

- **Limited availability of zip code specific rent price data** makes granular evaluation difficult, but team-level data shows interesting trends.

- Results varied significantly from team to team; few teams independently reached statistical significant _(SDN, WAS, BAL, SDN)_

# Potential Improvements for Future Study

## Limited availability of zip code level rent data
- Analysis was conducted with only 149 observations, making findings difficult to verify on a team level.

## Zip code not a perfect proxy for surrounding neighborhood
- Future study could use coordinate data to establish standard geoperimeter around stadiums.]

## Additional control variables may improve validity
- Examples include population size/market size, urban development, etc.

## Isolate home wins as explanatory variable
- Are rent prices more responsive when a team is successful in their home stadium?
